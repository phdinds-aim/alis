Social Network Graphs
=====================

As network connectivity improves, more individuals are getting involved in social media activities. In the last quarter of 2021, Facebook has roughly 2.91 billion active users. In the Philippines alone, there are around 75 million users. For twitter, thereâ€™s 400 million worldwide and 10 million users in the Philippines. Analyzing social networks enables us to gain a better understanding of the community structure by visualizing the relationships that link them together as a network. Through this analysis, we can identify key individuals, isolate groupings within the network ('communities'), and/or establish associations between the individuals.With the massive amount of data available, we require the appropriate tools to analyze it.

In this chapter, we will discuss the foundations of social network graphs and introduce tools to analyze them.
