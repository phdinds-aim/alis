Installation
============

To install the package, perform the following step.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install python-alis

``ALIS`` was built using a Python version of ``3.8.12``. For a more robust installation, we recommend creating an environment for your project. Afterwards, you can install the required package via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can create an environment using ``conda`` along with the required packages. You may use the following command below:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate alis
