    "# Filtering Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case is filtering data in a stream. In this case we have a set $S$ of data that we want to filter for, but the size of $S$ is too large to fit in memory. Additionally, it is assumed that the elements in $S$ are only a small fraction of the universal set, such that it will be a big benefit just to be able to quickly verify that a value isn't part of $S$. In that case we can use a **Bloom filter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bloom Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used for testing whether a value is a member of a set {cite:ps}`bloom1970space`. Instead of getting absolute *True* or *False* values when testing for membership, the Bloom filter instead returns True or False with the following meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True - Value is \"possibly\" in set.\n",
    "2. False - Value is **definitely** not in set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words the Bloom filter may return a false positive, but never a false negative. In return for this ambiguity the Bloom filter uses far less space than a hash table or a hash set, and is easier to keep in memory for fast lookups. There is a tradeoff between the space needed by the Bloom filter and the probability of getting a false positve, the larger the space utilized the less chance for getting false positives."
