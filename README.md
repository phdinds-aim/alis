# ALIS: Algorithmic Library for Scalability

ALIS: Algorithmic Library for Scalability is a Python package and a good accompanying reference for Leskovec, Rajaraman, and Ullman's [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/). This book currently covers topics from Chapters 3 through 5, and Chapter 10 of the reference.

This book provides:

1. Additional mathematical and code examples
2. Additional exercises both theoretical and practical
3. Re-useable API for scalable data mining

ALIS is inspired by the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) interactive book with code, math, and discussion.

## Installation

To install the package, perform the following step.

```
pip install python-alis
```

`ALIS` was built using a Python version of `3.8.12`. For a more robust installation, we recommend creating an environment for your project. Afterwards, you can install the required package via `pip`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can create an environment using `conda` along with the required packages. You may use the following command below:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate alis
```
